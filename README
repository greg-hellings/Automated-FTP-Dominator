=== Requires ===
Python 3.1 (accessible from /usr/bin/python3.1 - this is the default for Ubuntu 9.10)
If you have your Python 3.1 executable somewhere else, edit the require location at
the top of the files.

To execute a single upload to a given address, cd into the publisher/ directory and
execute the following command:

./publisher.py ftp://<username>:<password>@<host>/<path> <file | directory>

The script will then login to <host> with <username> and <password> authentication tokens
and will upload the file or directory specified to the destination you have specified.  That
location must already exist, but if you're uploading a directory to those locations, then
that directory and the whole tree under it will be created on the destination machine.
